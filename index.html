          <h2>About Duke</h2>
          <!-- some junk about me-->
            <p>I have been working in the IT field supporting the movie industry for the last 4 years. However with the current predictament we find ourselves in, this industry has been destroyed.</p>
            <p>So I was left with 2 options, take a similar position and work my way up through the ranks again with a new company or go seek out new knowledge and make a vertical move from supporting hardware/software to making the software. Im looking to learn with and maybe even help my peers as we all go on this journey to better ourselves. Massive segway, on my off days I play pick up soccer.</p>
            <p>After looking though a lot of boot camps and what they offer in terms of student growth and career follow through after graduation. Thinkful looks to shine above the rest. Only time will tell though.</p>
